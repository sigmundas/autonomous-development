"""Structured-payload validation against the bundled JSON Schemas.

The structured boundaries the controller currently validates here against a
bundled Draft 2020-12 schema — *before* the payload is published to a canonical
artifact or merged into run state — are the Codex enhance/plan/review outputs,
the reconciliation source and decision delta, the triage ledger, and implementation/fix
work-result metadata.
(Persisted run-state validation is not wired through this module yet; it is
deferred until the run-state schema is finalized.)

Design invariants:

* **Fail closed.** A schema that cannot be loaded, is itself invalid, or that
  the payload violates raises ``SchemaValidationError``. There is no silent
  downgrade to "assume valid": if we cannot certify a payload we reject it.
* **Deterministic, actionable errors.** Validation errors are sorted by their
  location and rendered with a JSON Pointer so the failing field is obvious and
  the message is stable across runs (important for tests and audit logs).
* **Cached validators.** Compiled validators are cached by schema path so
  repeated validation in a single process does not re-read or re-compile the
  schema.
