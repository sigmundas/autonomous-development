# Implement the accepted plan

Read the current run's accepted artifacts. Use `controller.py show-run` (or
`controller.py status --json`) to find the paths under `artifacts.accepted_spec` and
`artifacts.accepted_plan`, then read those files along with repository instructions and
relevant source/tests.

Then:

1. Confirm the workflow is active with `controller.py status`.
2. Implement only accepted scope, incrementally.
3. Preserve unrelated local modifications.
4. Add tests for every changed behavior and regression.
5. Keep interfaces backward compatible unless the accepted specification explicitly requires a break.
6. Include safe migration and rollback paths where applicable.
7. Update affected documentation and examples.
8. Set the phase to `implemented` when implementation is complete.

Record structured completion metadata before setting the phase:

```bash
controller.py record-work-result --kind implementation --file <work-result.json>
```

The JSON may contain `ui_review.groups` and/or `ui_review.scenarios`. For material visual changes,
use repository guidance or the renderer's `--list` command to select the smallest useful set of
real registered states, including important adjacent regression risks. Do not invent IDs or select
all scenarios merely because UI code changed. Omit `ui_review` for non-visual work.

Never push, merge, deploy, access production, rotate credentials, or apply irreversible migrations.
